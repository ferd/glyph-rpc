encoding:
	remove newlines in query args?
caching
	caching headers added to responses
	@cache(max_age=....)
	change url schema to avoid ?

forms/links
	type args?

	url templates
	destroy H<name> i.e no difference between link/form?

	browser impl?

to think?

	Glyph.refresh?

	uri templates for get args

	argle bargel transactions:

		@foo.if_none_match() .... ?
		@foo.last_modified()

	collections:
		like an embed/property, but behaves with the __getitem__ calls ?
		think about interface for pagination/mapping to an infinite scroll, etc.
		inlining - behaves like a link, isn't.
		cursor/resultset behavior?

	snapshoting:
		crawling an api? glyph.crawl(page) returns all links() ?

	api versioning?

	transactions?
		preconditions/postconditions on forms

	demos:
		heroku/appengine ?
		examples for a talk?
		atom pub mail server?  mail store? forum queue/broker(herp?)
			use preconditions to do transactional semantics?
		tekpub/
